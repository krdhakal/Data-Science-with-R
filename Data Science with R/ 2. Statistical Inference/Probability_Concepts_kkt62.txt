
1) Random experiements - Where outcome cannot be predicted with certainity for example tossing a coin (may get head or tail)

2) Sample space - possible set of outcomes - for tossing a coin {H,T}, roll a die {1,2,3,4,5,6}

3) Event - set of outcome of an experiment - getting a tail when tossing a coin = 1/2

Event are of two types 

1) Disjoint events - do not have any common outcomes for example rolling a die and tossing a coin P(A and B) = 0

2) Non disjoint events - can have common outcomes for example students studing statistics as well as data science P(A and B) # 0

Independent events - Occurence of one doesn't affect the other for example tossing of a coin two times, outcomes may or may not be similar

Introduction of Bayes theorem (conditional probability)

What is the probability given the below statistics that woman has breast cancer if she has a positive mammograph results..

1) One percent of women over 50 age have breast cancer
2) 90% of the women who have breast cancer test comes positive on mammograph
3) 8% of the women will have false positive (predictive positive for breast cancer although women didn't had that)

P(breast cancer|positive on test) = ?
P(breast cancer) = 0.01
P(no breast cancer) = 1-0.01 = 0.99
P(test positive|breast cancer) = 0.90
p(test positive|no breast cancer) = 0.08

P(breast cancer|positive on test) = P(positive on test|breast cancer) * P (breast cancer)
                                      -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                    P(positive on test|breast cancer)*P (breast cancer) + P(positive on test|no breast cancer)* P (no breast cancer)
