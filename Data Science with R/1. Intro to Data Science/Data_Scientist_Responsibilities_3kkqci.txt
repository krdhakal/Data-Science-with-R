What can be possible challenges

1) Isolated Datasets - C+/C++, SQL Oracle, Papers - no uniform structure
2) No tools and technologies for big data - R/python, SAS
3) Open source platforms - R/python
4) Architecture - RAM/Hard disk

Life of Data scientists

1) Curiosity -> Translate messy problem into a business problem Why? Why? Why?
2) Data Aquisition -> Different sources (Excel, website, Twitter)
3) Data wrangling/exploration -> variable selection, transformation, visulalization

4) Modelling ML -> Different type of models
5) Check accuracy of models -> 6 different models for one use-case, >75%-90%

6) Communication and Visualization
7) Deployment of model in production environment -> use the same environment similar to production, JAVA+R 

8) Continous feedback from production - feedback collection
